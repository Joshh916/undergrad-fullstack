CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

# Architecture
Express is used as the server to server files to the client. HTML is used in conjuntion with Typescript files in Angular to dynamically build web pages. In Express, HBS and javascript are used in conjunction with HTML files to dynamically build web pages. The single page application provides the page layouts on the initial load of the webpage and subsequent requests only require a request to the database for page information rather than loading the entire page each time. MongoDB is a fast database application that stores the data as a JSON document. This is beneficial for a wide spectrum of data types.

# Functionality
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation which is built of key/value pairs in order and is supported by virtually all modern programming languages. Reusable interfaces such as the angular list-trip component which renders the trips on multiple pages help to save processing power and reduce the amount of data needed to be transfered frommserver to client. The trip list was also refactored to improve performance. Listing the trip as part of an Angular component rather than rendering it in HTML improves reusability.

# Testing
Angular has a testing API's available which can be implemented to complete various types of automated function tests and regression tests, but these were disabled for this class assignment. The testing that I completed as part of the full stack development process was a product of incremental development and functionality testing. After each section of coding I would test the functionality of the added code and debug.

# Reflection
This course has helped me reach my professional goals by gaining experience into full stack development. I am now more familiar with Javascript which is very wiedly used in the Software Engineering field for various purposes.
